## How to use the app :scroll:

Using my music news scraper is dead simple:

1) Hit the scrape button to grab the latest articles from NPR's music news feed.

1) Read through the articles and click the link to read the full story on the NPR site.

1) Click 'Save article' to move it over to the Saved Articles section up on the navbar.

1) When viewing your saved articles, you can unsave to move it back to the home page.

1) Notes are shared between users. Feel free to edit/remove any as you see fit, but try leaving something relevant to the article!

## How the app works :bulb:

The articles are scraped using __axios__ & __cheerio__, then stored using __MongoDB__. __Bootstrap__ and __Google Fonts__ contribute to the simple but punchy style, and I use __Handlebars__ to populate the pages with articles.

### Enjoy your articles! :v:
